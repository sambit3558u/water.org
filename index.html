        <H2>What is Water?</H2>
        <p>Water is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless liquid that is essential for all known forms of life. Its
            chemical formula is H₂O, meaning each molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom.
            It is the most common solvent on Earth and is found in various states: liquid, solid (ice), and gas (vapor).
            In nature, water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface, mostly in the form of oceans, lakes, and rivers,
            and it is a crucial component of the water cycle, constantly circulating through evaporation, condensation,
            and precipitation.

        <H2>History of Water on Earth</H2>
        <p>One factor in estimating when water appeared on Earth is that water is continually being lost to space. H2O
            molecules in the atmosphere are broken up by photolysis, and the resulting free hydrogen atoms can sometimes
            escape Earth's gravitational pull. When the Earth was younger and less massive, water would have been lost
            to space more easily. Lighter elements like hydrogen and helium are expected to leak from the atmosphere
            continually, but isotopic ratios of heavier noble gases in the modern atmosphere suggest that even the
            heavier elements in the early atmosphere were subject to significant losses.In particular, xenon is useful
            for calculations of water loss over time. Not only is it a noble gas (and therefore is not removed from the
            atmosphere through chemical reactions with other elements), but comparisons between the abundances of its
            nine stable isotopes in the modern atmosphere reveal that the Earth lost at least one ocean of water early
            in its history, between the Hadean and Archean eons.

        <H2>Properties of Water</H2>
        <p>Water (H2O) is a polar inorganic compound that is at room temperature a tasteless and odorless liquid, which
            is nearly colorless apart from an inherent hint of blue. It is by far the most studied chemical compound and
            is described as the "universal solvent" and the "solvent of life".It is the most abundant substance on the
            surface of Earth and the only common substance to exist as a solid, liquid, and gas on Earth's surface. It
            is also the third most abundant molecule in the universe (behind molecular hydrogen and carbon
            monoxide).Water molecules form hydrogen bonds with each other and are strongly polar. This polarity allows
            it to dissociate ions in salts and bond to other polar substances such as alcohols and acids, thus
            dissolving them. Its hydrogen bonding causes its many unique properties, such as having a solid form less
            dense than its liquid form, a relatively high boiling point of 100 °C for its molar mass, and a high heat
            capacity.

        <H2>Water Pollution</H2>
        <p>Water pollution (or aquatic pollution) is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their
            uses. It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers,
            reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies.
            Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities,
            agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.Water pollution may affect either surface
            water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic
            ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or
            irrigation. Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water
            resource.Sources of water pollution are either point sources or non-point sources. Point sources have one
            identifiable cause, such as a storm drain, a wastewater treatment plant or an oil spill. Non-point sources
            are more diffuse. An example is agricultural runoff. Pollution is the result of the cumulative effect over
            time. Pollution may take many forms. One would is toxic substances such as oil, metals, plastics,
            pesticides, persistent organic pollutants, and industrial waste products. Another is stressful conditions
            such as changes of pH, hypoxia or anoxia, increased temperatures, excessive turbidity, or changes of
            salinity. The introduction of pathogenic organisms is another. Contaminants may include organic and
            inorganic substances. A common cause of thermal pollution is the use of water as a coolant by power plants
            and industrial manufacturers.
